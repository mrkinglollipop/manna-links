description: >-
  Find stocks sharing the "CINF archetype" — low-volatility dividend compounders that
  grind upward over time, reliably recover from drawdowns, and are well suited to
  selling covered calls (and cash-secured puts / the wheel) against. Screens a stock
  universe on quantified "trustworthiness" + covered-call-fit traits, scores each name
  0–100 across five pillars, gates out the unfit, and ranks candidates by similarity to
  a reference anchor (default CINF). The logic is validated out-of-sample on the 2008
  GFC. Use when asked to find CINF-like / "trustworthy" / "only goes up over time" /
  covered-call / wheel / income-compounder candidate stocks, or to score one ticker.

# Fortress Compounder Screener

Cincinnati Financial (CINF) is unusually good to sell covered calls against and behaves
as if it "only goes up over time." This skill distills *why* into measurable traits and
screens any dividend-paying universe to find other stocks like it. It is a quantitative,
deterministic screen — no LLM calls, no API calls in the core path.

## What makes CINF special (the archetype)

CINF is a property-&-casualty insurer that invests its insurance float in an unusually
large **common-equity portfolio** (Berkshire-like) rather than the all-bond book its
peers hold. That single structural choice makes book value compound at equity-like rates,
which is the engine behind the slow, durable upward grind. Layered on top is a **66-year
consecutive dividend-increase streak** (a Dividend King) that was **never cut even through
a 63% drawdown in 2008–2009** — which creates a price-insensitive income-buyer base and a
yield floor that defends the stock on dips.

The honest reframe that drives this skill: **"trustworthy" does not mean "low drawdown."**
CINF fell **−63%** in the GFC and took **6.6 years** to make a new high. Trustworthy means
it **always recovers to new highs** and the **dividend keeps rising the entire time you
wait** — you get *paid to hold through the dip, and the dip always ends in a new high.*
That profile is covered-call gold: a slow grind (shares rarely called away on a moonshot),
moderate-but-persistent implied volatility (harvestable premium), and dividend-supported
mean reversion. The edge a call-seller monetizes is **recovery-certainty, not downside
protection.**

CINF's measured profile (from local data): beta 0.71 (recent) / 1.04 (full-history),
realized vol ~19.9% trailing / 29.7% full, price CAGR ~6.9%/yr (~9–10% with dividends),
60% of years positive, dividend yield ~2.2%, payout ~19–43%, ROE ~18%, near-zero leverage.
It scores **98/100 (ELITE)** on this screen.

## The traits — five quantified pillars (0–100)

| Pillar | Measures | Metric & threshold | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Dividend reliability** (0–25) | Commitment / buyer-base floor | Consecutive years dividend maintained-or-raised (split-adjusted run-rate). ≥10 candidate, ≥25 Aristocrat, ≥50 King | A multi-decade streak signals management commitment and attracts price-insensitive income buyers who defend dips |
| **B. Trust / recovery** (0–25) | Does it come back, and can it not? | 100% historical recovery to new highs after drawdowns; positive book value; ROE ≥10%; sane leverage | Covered calls cannot protect a *permanent* impairment — only quality avoids that |
| **C. Grind quality** (0–20) | Slow up, not explosive | Price CAGR in 3–15% sweet spot; ≥55% positive years; ≤~6 days/yr with \|move\|>5%; persistent above 200-day MA | "Grinds up" keeps strikes out-of-the-money; "rips up" gets your shares called away and caps the move that justified the risk |
| **D. Low-vol / beta** (0–20) | Calm enough to sell against | Trailing-1yr realized vol 12–28%; beta 0.30–0.85 | High vol = overnight gap-through and assignment whipsaw; low vol = predictable premium harvesting |
| **E. VRP / liquidity** (0–10) | Is the premium real & tradeable? | (Tier-2) implied vol persistently > realized + adequate option open interest. Core path uses a stock-liquidity proxy | The variance-risk-premium (IV>realized) is the structural edge in *selling* options |

**Hard gates (a candidate must pass all):** dividend streak ≥10 · trailing vol ≤35% ·
beta ≤1.10 · ≥8 years of price history · recovered to new highs (track record) · market
cap ≥$1B and price $5–$1000 · free-cash-flow not negative. A name failing any gate is
reported with the reason, not silently dropped.

**Verdicts:** ELITE ≥80 · STRONG ≥68 · FAIR ≥55 · WEAK <55. Note the score *saturates* near
the cap for top-tier names — many genuine fortresses tie at the high end (the pillars are capped
and a pre-filtered quality universe maxes them out), so use the CINF-distance below to rank among
the ELITE cluster rather than the raw score alone.

**Similarity-to-CINF:** beyond the absolute score, every candidate gets a z-scored
Euclidean **distance to the anchor** (default CINF) across the trait vector, so you can ask
directly for "the stocks most *like* CINF," not just "the highest-scoring."

What a top screen surfaces (face-valid): CINF, Ecolab, Casey's, Costco, Linde, Waste
Management, PepsiCo, and fellow insurers Travelers / Marsh / Assurant — the boring-fortress
archetype. High-vol momentum (NVDA, TSLA) and post-cut dividend traps (AT&T, 3M, whose
streak resets to ~0 on the cut) are correctly rejected.

## Out-of-sample validation — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING IT

The framework was tested out-of-sample: score the survivor universe using **only data on
or before 2007-12-31** (no look-ahead), then measure each name's **actual 2008–2014 GFC
outcome**. Result across 3,088 names:

| 2007 verdict | dividend cut | recovered by 2014 | median drawdown |
|---|---|---|---|
| ELITE (n=11) | **0%** | **100%** | −42% |
| STRONG (n=48) | 2% | 98% | −53% |
| FAIR (n=175) | 36% | 86% | −55% |
| WEAK (n=2,854) | **65%** | 71% | −62% |

**Passing the 2007 gates cut the dividend-cut rate from 62% to 21%.** A high score, computed
with no knowledge of the future, genuinely tilted toward GFC survival and recovery. This is
a real, earned edge.

**It is a tilt, not a guarantee. Three hard bounds — do not ignore them:**

1. **No score is a safety.** General Electric scored STRONG as of 2007, then fell **−89%**,
   never recovered, and cut its dividend. Roughly 1 in 50 of the top bucket still detonated.
2. **Deep drawdowns are normal even for winners** (ELITE median −42%; CINF −63%). Covered-call
   premium (~2–3%/month) does **not** offset that. The edge is recovery-certainty and getting
   paid to wait — *never* downside protection.
3. **Survivorship caps confidence.** The screen only sees stocks that still exist today.
   **~28% of the 60 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats of 2007 cut their dividend within three
   years** of the GFC, and several (GE, BAC) took 15+ years to recover or never did — those
   failures are partly invisible to a present-day database. Treat the output as a
   *resemblance-to-survivors* score, not a *survival-probability*.

## How to use it (covered-call workflow)

1. **Screen** for ELITE/STRONG candidates (or nearest-neighbors to CINF).
2. **Diversify.** The ~28% historical crisis-cut base rate means single-name risk is real —
   spread across many fortress names; never concentrate the thesis in one.
3. **Size for a 50–60% drawdown** on any single position. The recovery is reliable; the path
   is not gentle.
4. **Time the call sale by implied volatility.** The variance-risk-premium is *episodic* —
   sell calls when IV rank is elevated (≥30–50), not when IV is asleep. (At research time
   CINF's IV rank was only ~27, i.e. thin premium — a great *stock* but a poor *entry* for
   selling.)
5. **Let the gates do their job.** Names that have cut (AT&T, 3M) or are in permanent decline
   auto-fail on the streak/recovery gates — that is the screen catching the walking wounded.

## CLI / usage

```bash
# Score one ticker (full diagnostic — metrics, five pillar sub-scores, gates, verdict):
python3 scripts/fortress_screener.py --ticker CINF

# Full screen (top by Fortress Score AND nearest-neighbors to the anchor), write CSV:
python3 scripts/fortress_screener.py --top 40 --out matches.csv

# Change the similarity anchor, set a score floor, point at a different DB dir:
python3 scripts/fortress_screener.py --anchor PG --min-score 70 --fmp-dir /path/to/fmp

# Re-run the out-of-sample validation:
python3 scripts/backtest_asof2007.py --out backtest.csv
```

## Dependencies

- **Core (Tier-1): Python 3.9+ standard library only** — `sqlite3, statistics, math,
  datetime, csv, argparse, json`. **Nothing to pip install** when using the local data.
- **Data:** the local FMP SQLite databases — `price_history.sqlite` (daily_prices),
  `dividends.sqlite` (dividends; uses split-adjusted `adj_dividend`), `fundamentals.sqlite`
  (key_metrics_ttm with ratios_ttm fallback). Directory from `--fmp-dir` or `$FMP_DIR`,
  default `/Volumes/Cloud Storage/Databases/fmp`.
- **Optional:** `numpy`/`pandas` for faster full-universe screens (`--fast`); an options/IV
  source (Schwab, ORATS, or yfinance option chains) to activate the Tier-2 VRP/IV pillar.
- **Portability note:** the only data backend is FMP-schema SQLite (the `FMPStore` class). There
  is **no yfinance/online fallback** — running outside this workspace needs databases of the same
  schema (or a new adapter added to `FMPStore`).
- **Cursor:** registered via [`.cursor/rules/fortress-compounder-screener.mdc`](../../../.cursor/rules/fortress-compounder-screener.mdc)
  at the repo root, which tells Cursor's agent what the skill does, how to invoke it, and its exact
  dependencies. The scripts are pure stdlib with no workspace imports, so Cursor runs them directly
  — it only needs the FMP SQLite directory (`--fmp-dir`/`$FMP_DIR`). To use in another Cursor
  project, copy this skill folder and that `.mdc` into the project's `.cursor/rules/`.

## Limitations & honest caveats

- **Survivorship** is the core limit (see Validation). A fully survivorship-free backtest
  needs delisted-ticker price history, which the local DB does not carry; the FMP legacy
  delisted endpoint is retired. The honest external benchmark is the ~28% Aristocrat
  crisis-cut rate.
- **The E pillar currently measures *stock* dollar-liquidity, not *option* liquidity.** Until
  an options source is wired, do not treat it as evidence the *options* are tradeable —
  confirm the chain yourself.
- **Dividend-streak depth** is capped by the local dividend history (~1984), so the computed
  streak undercounts very long Kings (CINF computes 38 vs the true 66). Cross-reference a
  curated Aristocrat/King list for exact streak length.
- **The score does not penalize drawdown depth** — a name with an −80% history can still
  score ELITE. The max-drawdown column is shown for exactly this reason; read it.
- **`market_cap`, `book_value`, and `roe` come from fallbacks** — `key_metrics_ttm` leaves
  those three columns unpopulated, so the screener reads market cap from `enterprise_value`
  (≈ market cap for this low-leverage dividend universe), reads ROE from `ratios_ttm`, and
  infers positive book value from the `ratios_ttm` price-to-book. The ≥$1B size gate works;
  for a highly-leveraged name EV overstates market cap, so treat the size figure as approximate.
