# Lens: bugs

## Question

What correctness, edge, silent-failure, or a11y-functional defects exist on inventoried surfaces?

## In

- Wrong results, crashes, race/state bugs
- Edge inputs, empty states that fail functionally
- Silent failures (swallowed errors, false success)
- Functional a11y blockers (unreachable controls, missing labels that break use)

## Out

- Spec gaps vs docs without a defect (`gaps`)
- Pure polish / copy (`polish`)
- Roadmap features (`product`)

## Coverage floor (HARD)

See `references/finder-common.md` — bugs floor: ≥1 checked category per inventoried
surface (correctness | edge | silent-failure | a11y-functional); at least one
automated oracle when the repo provides one.

## Tool routing

Class verify lane + cheapest automated check (test/build/lint). a11y describe for
functional a11y when the class has a UI surface — **harness/loom/aegis:** smokes +
doctor only (a11y N/A → Tools missing). Record **Tools used** / **Tools missing**.

## Steps

1. Inventory hot paths (primary workflow + recent session touchpoints).
2. For each surface, check ≥1 category with evidence.
3. Cap 8 findings; prioritize HIGH/MEDIUM for fixer.

## Hard stop

No speculative refactors. No inventing defects without evidence.
